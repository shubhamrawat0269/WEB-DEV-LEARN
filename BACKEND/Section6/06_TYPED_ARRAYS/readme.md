# In this lecture, we are going to study about TypedArrays in Javascript which does similar thing like DataView i.e. to read/write data in AB. But the difference is they are specific in nature.

1. There is no such thing like TypedArray Constructor function. It is a category itself.
2. To Use TypedArrays, we have inbuilt constructor fn like **Int8Array()**, **uInt8Array()**.

3. Why this is called as TypedArray ? Solution : Bcuz , typedarray is specific i.e.
   A. We can only store integer value i.e. int
   B. U -> unsigned value storing only positive value. For Example, **Uint8Array**
   C. Normal method like **Int8Array** store positive and negative value
   D. 8 -> 8 bit of Data.
   Note : -- That's why they are called as typedArray.

4. Question comes -> How to read and write data inside ArrayBuffer using TypedArray.
   Solution -> It behaves similar to array.

For example , Uint8Array[0] = 0xf3; => write data
Uint8Array[0] => read data

Explore uint16Array as well.

5. By Default, TypedArray methods support **little Endian** means byte order reverse.
6. TypedArray methods automatically create Arraybuffer if you pass a number to params.

For Example,
const a = new ArrayBuffer(4); => X
const uInt8Array = new Uint8Array(4); => number as params.

7. We can also perform write operation inside TypedArray Methods,
   For Example,
   const uInt8Array = new Uint8Array([0xff,0xfe,0x8e,0x4c]);

8. There's also one method i.e. fill() . Use it like below:
   const uInt8Array = new Uint8Array(4).fill(0xff);

9. Understanding detached, resizable, maxByteLength property : 
   A. How can we change the maxByteLength property.
   B. new ArrayBuffer(4, {maxByteLength: 16})
   C. a.resize(8)
   D. We can detach any arrayBuffer using a.transfer() method.
   
10. Note : transfer method is new that's why it's not supportable to nodejs env.
